      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <br />
      <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) were last updated on September 01, 2021.</p>
      <br />
      <p>ScholarNest’s mission is to help professionals build their success and grow in their careers through continuous learning. We enable professionals to create and share educational content (instructors) and access that educational content to learn (students). We consider our platform a great way to offer valuable educational content to our users. We need rules to keep our platform and services safe for you, our student and instructor community, and us. These Terms apply to all your activities on the ScholarNest website, the ScholarNest mobile applications, our APIs, and other related services (“Services”).
      </p> <br /> <p>
        If you publish a course on the ScholarNest platform, you must also agree to the Instructor Terms presented to you when you join the instructor community. We also provide details regarding our processing of the personal data of our students and instructors in our Privacy Policy.</p>
      <br /><p>
        IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES. PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS REQUIRE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND SCHOLARNEST TO BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT BY ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
      </p> <br /><p>
        Please read these Terms carefully before using the Website or purchasing a subscription to the Services. By using the Website and/or purchasing a subscription, you accept and agree to these Terms.</p>

<br />
<h2>1. Accounts</h2><br />
<p>
You need an account for most activities on our platform. Keep your password somewhere safe because you’re responsible for all activity associated with your account. If you suspect someone else is using your account, let us know by contacting our Support Team. You must have reached the age of consent for online services in your country to use ScholarNest.
</p><br /><p>
You need an account for most activities on our platform, including purchasing and accessing content or submitting content for publication. When setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account without your permission. It means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account. If you contact us to request access to an account, we will not grant you such access unless you can provide us with the information that we need to prove you are the owner of that account. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be closed.
</p><br /><p>
You may not share your account login credentials with anyone else. You are responsible for what happens with your account, and ScholarNest will not intervene in disputes between students or instructors who have shared account login credentials. You must notify us immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission (or if you suspect any other breach of security) by contacting our Support Team. We may request some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of your account.
</p> <br /><p>
Students and instructors must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on ScholarNest and use the Services. If you are younger than 18 but above the required age for consent to use online services where you live, you may not set up an account. Still, we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an account and help you access appropriate content. If you are below this age of consent to use online services, you may not create a ScholarNest account. If we discover that you have created an account that violates these rules, we will terminate your account. Under our Instructor Terms, you may be requested to verify your identity before you are authorized to submit content for publication on ScholarNest.
</p> <br /><p>
You can terminate your account at any time by contacting our support team. Check our Privacy Policy to see what happens when you terminate your account.
</p>
<br />
<h2>
2. Content Enrollment and Access
</h2><br /><p>
When you enroll in a course or other content, you get a license from us to view it via the ScholarNest Services and no other use. Don’t try to transfer or resell the content in any way. We generally grant you a yearly access license or enrollments via Subscription Plans, except when we must disable the content for legal or policy reasons.
</p> <br /><p>
Under our Instructor Terms, when instructors publish content on ScholarNest, they grant ScholarNest a license to offer students a license to the content. It means that we have the right to sublicense the content to enrolled students. As a student, when you enroll in a course or other content, whether it’s free or paid content, you are getting a license from ScholarNest to view the content via the ScholarNest platform and Services, and ScholarNest is the licensor of record. Content is licensed and not sold to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the content in any manner (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the content and sharing it on torrent sites).
</p> <br /> <p>
In legal, more complete terms, ScholarNest grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non-commercial, educational purposes through the Services, per these Terms and any conditions or restrictions associated with the particular content or feature of our Services. All other uses are expressly prohibited. You may not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any content unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written agreement signed by a ScholarNest authorized representative. IT also applies to content you can access via any of our APIs.
</p> <br /> <p>
We generally give our students a yearly access license when they enroll in a course or other content. However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use any content at any point in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to the content due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course or other content you enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if we determine it violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines. This yearly access license does not apply to enrollments via Subscription Plans or add-on features and services associated with the course or other content you enroll. For example, instructors may decide to provide no teaching assistance or Q&A services associated with the content. To be clear, the yearly access is to the course content but not to the instructor.
</p> <br /><p>
Instructors may not grant licenses to their content to students directly, and any such direct license shall be null and void and a violation of these Terms.
</p> <br />
<h2>
3. Payments, Credits, and Refunds</h2> <br /><p>
When you make a payment, you agree to use a valid payment method. ScholarNest offers a 7-day refund for most content purchases if you aren’t happy with your content. We also offer a 7-day free trial for our subscription plan.
</p> <br />
<h3>
3.1 Pricing
</h3> <br /><p>
The prices of content on ScholarNest are determined based on the terms of the Instructor Terms and our Promotions Policy. In some instances, the content price offered on the ScholarNest website may not be the same as the price offered on our mobile applications due to mobile platform providers’ pricing systems and their policies around implementing sales and promotions.
</p> <br /><p>
We occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during which specific content is available at discounted prices for a set period. The price applicable to the content will be the price when you complete your purchase of the content (at checkout). Any price offered for particular content may also be different when logged into your account from the price available to users who aren’t registered or logged in because some of our promotions are available only to new users.
</p> <br /> <p>
The price currency is always Indian currency (INR/Rupees). We do not enable users to see pricing in other currencies.
</p> <br /> <p>
Suppose you are a student in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or value-added tax apply to consumer sales. In that case, we are responsible for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities. Depending on your location, the price you see may include such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout.
</p><br />
<h3>
3.2 Payments</h3> <br />
<p>
You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you authorize us to charge your debit or credit card or process other means of payment (such as direct debit or mobile wallet) for those fees. ScholarNest works with payment service providers to offer you the most convenient payment methods in your country and keep your payment information secure. We may update your payment methods using the information provided by our payment service providers.
</p> <br /><p>
When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorized payment method. If your payment method fails and you still get access to the content you are enrolling in, you agree to pay us the corresponding fees within thirty (7) days of notification from us. We reserve the right to disable access to any content for which we have not received adequate payment.
</p> <br /> <h3>
3.3 Refunds and Refund Credits
</h3> <br /> <p>
If the content you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request, within 7-days of your purchase of the content, that ScholarNest apply a refund to your account. This refund option does not apply to Subscription Plan purchases, which is covered in Section “Subscription Plans” below. We reserve the right to refund as a refund credit or a refund to your original payment method, or other at our discretion, depending on the capabilities of our payment service providers, the platform from which you purchased your content, and other factors. No refund is due to you if you request it after the 7-day guarantee time limit has passed. However, if the content you previously purchased is disabled for legal or policy reasons, you are entitled to a refund beyond this 7-day limit. ScholarNest also reserves the right to refund students beyond the 7-day limit in suspected or confirmed account fraud cases.
</p> <br /> <p>
To request a refund, contact our support team. As detailed in your Instructor Terms, instructors agree that students have the right to receive these refunds.
</p> <br /> <p>
If we decide to issue refund credits to your account, they will be automatically applied towards your next content purchase on our website but can’t be used for purchases in our mobile applications. Refund credits may expire if not used within the specified period and have no cash value in each case unless otherwise required by applicable law.
</p> <br /> <p>
At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our refund policy, such as if you’ve consumed a significant portion of the content that you want to refund or if you’ve previously refunded the content, we reserve the right to deny your refund, restrict you from other future refunds, ban your account, and/or restrict all future use of the Services. If we ban your account or disable your access to the content due to your violation of these Terms, you will not be eligible to receive a refund.
</p> <br /><h3>
3.4 Gift and Promotional Codes</h3> <br /> <p>
ScholarNest or our partners may offer gift and promotional codes to students. You may redeem specific codes for a gift or promotional credits applied to your ScholarNest account, which then may be used to purchase eligible content on our platform, subject to the terms included with your codes. Other codes may be directly redeemable for specific content. You cannot use gift and promotional credits for purchases in our mobile applications.
</p> <br /> <p>
These codes and credits, as well as any promotional value linked to them, may expire if not used within the period specified in your ScholarNest account. Gift and promotional codes offered by ScholarNest may not be refunded for cash unless otherwise specified in the terms included with your codes or as required by applicable law. Gift and promotional codes offered by a partner are subject to that partner’s refund policies. If you have multiple saved credit amounts, ScholarNest may determine which credits to apply to your purchase.
</p> <br />
<h2>
4. Content and Behavior Rules</h2> <br /> <p>
You can only use ScholarNest for lawful purposes. You’re responsible for all the content that you post on our platform. You should keep the reviews, questions, posts, courses, and other content you upload in line with the law and respect the intellectual property rights of others. We can ban your account for repeated or major offenses. If you think someone is infringing your copyright on our platform, let us know.
</p> <br /> <p>
You may not access or use the Services or create an account for unlawful purposes. Your use of the Services and behavior on our platform must comply with your country’s applicable local or national laws or regulations. You are solely responsible for knowing and complying with such laws and regulations that apply to you.

</p> <br />
<p>
If you are a student, the Services enable you to ask the instructors of courses or other content you are enrolled in and post content reviews in some instances. For certain content, the instructor may invite you to submit content as “homework” or tests. Don’t post or submit anything that is not yours.
</p><br />
<p>
If you are an instructor, you can submit content for publication on the platform, and you can also communicate with the students who have enrolled in your courses or other content. In both cases, you must abide by the law and respect the rights of others: you cannot post any course, question, answer, review, or other content that violates applicable local or national laws or regulations of your country. You are solely responsible for any courses, content, and actions you post or take via the platform and Services and their consequences. Ensure you understand all the copyright restrictions outlined in the Instructor Terms before submitting any content for publication on ScholarNest.
</p> <br /><p>
If we are put on notice that your course or content violates the law or the rights of others (for example, if it is established that it violates the intellectual property or image rights of others or is about an illegal activity), if we discover that your content or behavior violates our policy, or if we believe your content or behavior is unlawful, inappropriate, or objectionable (for example if you impersonate someone else), we may remove your content from our platform.
</p> <br /><p>
ScholarNest has discretion in enforcing these Terms. We may restrict or terminate your permission to use our platform and Services or ban your account at any time, with or without notice, for any or no reason, including for any violation of these Terms, if you fail to pay any fees when due, for fraudulent chargeback requests, upon the request of law enforcement or government agencies, for extended periods of inactivity, for unexpected technical issues or problems, if we suspect that you engage in fraudulent or illegal activities, or for any other reason in our sole discretion. Upon any such termination, we may delete your account and content and prevent you from further access to the platforms and use of our Services. Your content may still be available on the platforms even if your account is terminated or suspended. You agree that we will have no liability to you or any third party for termination of your account, removal of your content, or blocking your access to our platforms and services.
</p> <br /><p>
If a user has published content that infringes your copyright or trademark rights, please let us know. Our Instructor Terms require our instructors to follow the law and respect the intellectual property rights of others.
</p><br />
<h2>
5. ScholarNest’s Rights to Content You Post </h2> <br />
<p>
You retain ownership of the content you post to our platform, including your courses. We’re allowed to share the same content with anyone through any media, including promoting it via advertising on other websites.
</p> <br /><p>
The content you post as a student or instructor (including courses) remains yours. By posting courses and other content, you allow ScholarNest to reuse and share it, but you do not lose any ownership rights you may have over your content. If you are an instructor, be sure to understand the content licensing terms detailed in your Instructor Terms.
</p> <br /><p>
When you post content, comments, questions, reviews, and when you submit to us ideas and suggestions for new features or improvements, you authorize ScholarNest to use and share this content with anyone, distribute it and promote it on any platform and in any media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit.
In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the platforms, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute your content (including your name and image) in any and all media or distribution methods (existing now or later developed). It includes making your content available to other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with ScholarNest for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication of content on other media, as well as using your content for marketing purposes. You also waive any rights of privacy, publicity, or other rights of a similar nature applicable to all these uses, to the extent permissible under applicable law. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power, and authority to authorize us to use any content you submit. You also agree to all such uses of your content with no compensation paid to you
